Part #1 of assingment 5 requires creating 5 bubbles with relatively random movement utilizing the 'update' and 'show' functions after defining separate individual
variables for each separate bubble which is created by the 'bubble' callback gifted to us in the assingments details. My code has 5 simple lil' bubbles with 
varying size and location and a pretty basic color scheme. I'm working on adding more movement but I may have done something incorrectly as right now I'd describe
them more as jittery than 'moving'.
