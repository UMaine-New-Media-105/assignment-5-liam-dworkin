Part #1 of assingment 5 requires creating 5 bubbles with relatively random movement utilizing the 'update' and 'show' functions after defining separate individual
variables for each separate bubble which is created by the 'bubble' callback gifted to us in the assingments details. My code has 5 simple lil' bubbles with 
varying size and location and a pretty basic color scheme. I'm working on adding more movement but I may have done something incorrectly as right now I'd describe
them more as jittery than 'moving'.

Part #2 of my assignment ends up using a nested loop, a for loop and the array along with then using the class/new functions to update/show in the second loop 50 of my bubbles. I still have the random movement function on, have edited the placement a bit since Part #1 and have changed the size and amount of bubbles to the required 50.
The only issue I am currently encountering is no matter what I try I can't get the 'boundary' issue to function correctly. All the bubbles still bounce in and out of the canvas regardless of what I have tried. I left in some old code commented out and an experiment I tried with having 'move' hold part of the conditional for boundaries. It did not work.

Part #3 involves adding in simulation sprites. There is a single sprite that will get larger as it interacts with the feeder particles (orange balls that are 'bubble') and then also it will get smaller and 'weaker' when it hits the 'bad' bubbles "bubbleBad". Right now it's not fully functioning but my goal is to get all the interaction down for Part #4. I want to try and do a different sim: one that presents the trolly problem to a sprite that must decide how it chooses to interact; however, I don't think I'm technically capable enough to do so.

Part #4 has the breeders and catchers become active. I have finally got my breeders, catchers, and particles to all move independently; however, I'm still having boundary issues. It's causing pain for collision as well so right now it's not actively producing or negating breeders when they collide with catchers. I also think I f*cked* it up and so I'm gonna ask John/VJ after class how to implement it without getting lost and ruining what I've currently got. If I can get border collision down I'm almost there in terms for bringing it all together.
